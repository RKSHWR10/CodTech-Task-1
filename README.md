OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

Password Strength Checker - Program Overview
The Password Strength Checker is a Python-based tool designed to assess the security level of user-generated passwords. This program evaluates the strength of passwords by analyzing various factors such as length, complexity, and the presence of common patterns.

Key Features:
Length Analysis:

The program checks if the password meets minimum length requirements (8 characters) and awards additional points for passwords that are 12 characters or longer.
Complexity Analysis:

The tool evaluates the diversity of characters in the password, including the presence of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special symbols. Each of these characteristics contributes to the overall strength score.
Common Pattern Detection:

The program reduces the strength score if the password contains common, easily guessed patterns or sequences like "password", "1234", or "qwerty".
Feedback Mechanism:

Based on the calculated score, the program provides a simple and clear feedback regarding the password strength, categorizing it as Weak, Moderate, or Strong.
How the Program Works:
The user is prompted to input a password.
The program evaluates the password against predefined criteria.
The strength of the password is displayed to the user, indicating its security level.
Usage:
This tool is particularly useful for individuals or organizations looking to encourage stronger password practices. By providing instant feedback, users are more likely to create passwords that are robust and less susceptible to attacks.

Technical Details:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used: re (for regular expression matching)
Input: User-generated password
Output: Password strength categorized as "Weak", "Moderate", or "Strong"
This Password Strength Checker serves as a basic but effective solution to promote better password hygiene, which is a critical aspect of cybersecurity. The program is straightforward, easy to understand, and can be easily extended with additional features or integrated into larger security systems.
